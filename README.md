# Amazon-Clone
This project is a static clone of the Amazon landing page, built using pure HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or responsiveness. It replicates the visual design and structure of the original Amazon homepage, focusing solely on layout and styling to demonstrate proficiency in front-end development fundamentals.
